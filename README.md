# LilAPI App
### News & Weather

This little API app combines two of Jordan Singers [Lil Software API's](http://lil.software/api/) into one app. The goal with this app was to learn how to properly add multiple APIs with reusable models and view models. I structured this based off of [Tundsdev](https://www.youtube.com/tundsdev) News API tutorial as I really like how he uses enums and switches to control the views and such.

Constructive criticism is always welcome, it is how we grow and learn. You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/halluxdev).
