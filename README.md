# LilAPI App
### News & Weather

This little API app combines two of Jordan Singers [Lil Software API's](http://lil.software/api/) into one app. The goal with this app was to learn how to properly add multiple APIs with reusable models and view models. I structured this based off of [Tundsdev](https://www.youtube.com/tundsdev) News API tutorial as I really like how he uses enums and switches to control the views and such.

## Issues 
Current issue I am facing is that, when trying to load the data from the API, it's not properly fetching but is simply showing the `ErrorView()`. 

## Feedback
Constructive criticism is always welcome, it is how we grow and learn. You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/halluxdev).
